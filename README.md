## Overview
This project focuses on applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in game development.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To generate a Python program with a GUI for a game named "Magnetic Cave".
- To manage game state, player moves, and win conditions using functions like `create_board()`, `update_cell()`, and `check_win()`.
- To deal with AI decision-making, heuristic evaluation, and game state management.

## languauge Used
The project extensively uses Python.

## Procedure
- The project covers the creation of the game board and the implementation of game mechanics using Python.
- It focuses on the implementation of the AI's heuristic evaluation function for scoring board configurations and the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making.
